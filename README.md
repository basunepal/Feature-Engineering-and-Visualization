# Feature-Engineering-and-Visualization
This project explores the power of feature engineering and visualization in enhancing machine learning model performance. Using the Airbnb NYC Listings dataset, we engineer new features, analyze their importance, and create informative visualizations to uncover insights about pricing trends and feature relationships.

# Key Highlights:

- Feature Engineering: Transform existing attributes into meaningful features for improved predictions.
- Data Visualization: Explore patterns in location, room type, and pricing using advanced visual storytelling.
- Model Evaluation: Train models, predict prices, and evaluate using RMSE and R-squared metrics.
- Insights: Discover actionable trends for Airbnb pricing strategies.

This project is a hands-on example of leveraging data to enhance predictive modeling while providing business-relevant insights.
